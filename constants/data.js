      `I've been in love with software development since the moment I wrote my first line of JavaScript, even though I had no idea what I was doing. Back then, I was just trying to figure out why my button wouldn’t center on the page (spoiler: it was CSS). Now I find myself laughing at my past struggles, while still occasionally Googling "center div CSS."`,
      `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using bootstrap so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew bootstrap, you were cool.`,
      `But now, I'm a legend. I've been coding in React, Angular, Vue, Java, Node.js, Express, Spring Boot, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, C, C++, C#, PHP, Assembly etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!).`,
